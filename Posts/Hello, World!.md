# Hello, World!

The very first blog post, because one always needs to start somewhere.

## Who am I?

My name's Petar Peychev and I'm a Computer Science student at [Nottingham Trent University](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/) and former Software Engineering student of [SoftUni](https://softuni.org/). I was born in a small fishing town called [Tutrakan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutrakan) on the right bank of the [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) in [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria).

Throughout my brief stay on this planet, I have been captivated by many seemingly unconnected ideas, gadgets and pursuits. My main activities revolve around the field of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), but I love exploration too much to exclusively specialise. Here's a small subset of the things, which occupy my mind sometimes:

**Mind ⊇ {**[chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [phở](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho), [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [mindfulness meditation](https://samharris.org/how-to-meditate/), [hip-hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop), [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism)**}**

## Why am I blogging?

People love lists. Here's a list of reasons:

* **Learning by explaining**
One of the widely-known pieces of applied psychology is the fact that [explaining something to others is a great way to learn](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2016/03/explaining-yourself). I intend to use this blog as an engine to drive my learning process, while simultaneously getting some content as a side effect.

* **Cultivating an online identity**
As having an online footprint is practically inevitable these days, especially for someone in my field, a personal blog is a tool one can use to curate their digital identity.

* **An outlet for miscellaneous thoughts**
With constantly getting distracted by new and exciting ideas, I often find myself struggling to find a place to store various thought nuggets. Tools, which have all served this purpose in my life before include [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/), physical journals, a frighteningly massive [Google Docs](https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/) file, and any friend who might listen. I hope to use the blog as another such outlet, where I can initially deposit ideas and eventually develop them into complete posts.

## What kind of content can you expect?

My plan is to dedicate the majority of the content here towards computing-related topics, but still put out the occasional miscellaneous post. A rough balance, which I'll strive towards is 80/20%. With my current obsession being programming languages and compilers/interpreters, related content will probably follow.
